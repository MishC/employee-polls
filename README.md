# Employee-polls. 

A delicate webapp written in React and state is tored in Redux. Employees can add a poll (a question) with answers A or B. For each question, you can see details like who posed that question and who answered it. That employee with the biggest sum of questions asked + questions answered is the winner on the leaderboard.

### `npm test`

There are some jest files there initially. Must be updated.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
